# Colour-Palette-Analyzer
Import an image and see the colours that make it up!

## Reason for Creating:
I'm a big fan of the arts, especially cinematography, and colour is my favourite aspect to focus on. Occasionally, I'll be watching a movie, or looking at photos, and the colours will stick out to me (examples below). I created this project so I could easily find the dominant colours used.

- Films:

## To-Do List:
- Read through PIL documentation
- Create a Python script that will take an image file and output the three main colours of the image, along with their hex codes
- Create a front-end for a better user-experience and more practical use
